## About Me

I earned my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University. While I prefer writing code over writing papers, I developed [GitHub-Mole](https://jialinc.github.io/GitHubMole/) as part of my thesis. If you are a serious researcher, feel free to ignore meâ€”I haven't published papers in top-tier conferences.ðŸ˜¢ Oh, by the way, I can bench 335 lbs and squat 405 lbsâ€”kind of okay, I guess? ðŸ¤”

GitHub-Mole is a hybrid web/local application that can be deployed for collaborative use or operated locally for individual analysis. It enables users to mine and analyze comprehensive contribution histories of GitHub users while also assisting in the formation of software development teams using research-backed algorithms.

The application leverages GitHubâ€™s GraphQL and REST APIs to retrieve detailed information about user contributions, including repositories, commits, and other key activities. It features an intuitive, user-friendly interface that streamlines data management and analysis. Additionally, it incorporates a backend database to store mined data, allowing users to retrieve their results at any time.

GitHub-Mole has been used in the graduate-level course CSC/ECE 517: Object-Oriented Design and Development at North Carolina State University to facilitate software development team formation.
